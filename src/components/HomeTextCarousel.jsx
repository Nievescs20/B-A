        <p>As a child growing up in Upstate New York, I was always captivated by the world around me. I had an innate curiosity that led me to explore every nook and cranny of my surroundings, always searching for my next adventure.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>As I grew older, I found that I had a talent for capturing moments and memories through photography. I began to experiment with different cameras and techniques, and soon found that I had a true passion for the art of photography. Iâ€™ve spent countless hours researching books, watching online tutorials, as well as attending a few classes to learn the art of the craft.</p>

        <p>Today, at 21 years old I am proud to call myself a photographer. I specialize in capturing the beauty of the natural world. But more than anything I am grateful for the opportunity to share my passions with others, and to help capture their own moments and memories. Whether I am shooting a wedding, a landscape, or a portrait.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
        I approach every project with the same level of passion and commitment. Every image has the power to inspire, evoke emotion, as well as tell a story. I am blessed to be able to share that power with the world.</p>
